You will complete these each week in MyLab Statistics. The homework assignments will typically be due each week at 11:59pm the weeknight before our class meeting. (However, I strongly recommend trying to complete the homework before then.) You should get multiple attempts for MyLab homework problems.    I will drop the lowest conceptual score from each of the MyLab Homework categories.        Quizzes:    There will be several quizzes throughout the course. Each of quizzes will be made up of several objectives. You need to do the problem(s) corresponding to each objective perfectly to earn full credit for that objective.    On each of the days specified in the schedule, you will be allowed to re-try certain quizzes\/objectives. This will give you another chance to earn credit for objectives that you missed on your first attempt.    For quizzes you may use a 4x6 inch notecard, a basic, nonprogrammable calculator (no phone) and Excel (if the problem allows it).    During quizzes you may NOT search the internet or use other resources that are not allowed.        Exams:    There will be 3 in-class exams during this course: 2 midterm exams and a final exam. Questions will require your understanding of statistical concepts and their application to problem contexts.    You will be allowed to use an 8.5x11 inch sheet of notes and a basic, nonprogrammable calculator (no phone) during the exams. You must show your work and answers must be clearly presented to receive full credit. (Some problems may also allow the use of Excel.)    During exams you may NOT search the internet or use other resources that are not allowed.          Missed\/Late Work  I do not have to allow make-ups or accept late work, but I often consider them according to each student's situation. I strongly recommend asking me for extensions if you find yourself needing them. In general, communicating with me earlier rather than later about your situation makes it more likely that we can make some kind of arrangement appropriate to your situation. Let me know as soon as possible if you are going to miss a quiz or exam. If you don't notify me in advance of your absence, or if you do not have a valid excuse, you may not be allowed to make up the assignment\/assessment, and you may receive a score of zero for that assignment\/assessment.    How to be successful in QUAN 2010     Come to class and pay attention\/be engaged as we're working in class.    Ask for help as soon as you realize you need it!    Come to office hours!    Commit to spending a minimum of 5 hours per week (split among at least 3 different days) to complete and submit the assignments for the course on time.    Form a study group with your classmates and meet regularly to practice problems.    Check UCCS email daily for updates or Canvas announcements regarding the course, and reply to those messages when appropriate.    Regularly review the syllabus\/calendar so you don't miss due dates.    Read\/study the book!    Go to the QUAN tutoring center in Dwire ( ) and\/or the Mathematics Excel Center ( https:\/\/mathcenter.uccs.edu ) for tutoring       Attendance  It is the expectation of the College of Business that students will attend all classes. However, specific classroom attendance policies are left to the discretion of the instructors. Students are responsible for knowing the attendance policies of their individual instructors. Business instructors may drop students who do not attend the first class of the semester. This policy allows waitlisted students who do attend the first class to be added to the class. Students registering for classes after the first class must obtain approval from the instructor prior to enrolling in the class.  Class attendance is an important part of the educational process in this course. Our class time is valuable, and you’re expected to attend class regularly if you are able (and not sick). Talk to me if you have concerns about this.  The material builds on itself, so I really don’t want you to fall behind. If something comes up, such as illness, that prevents you from attending class, then let me know as soon as possible.

Here are instructions for how to do this:      After doing this, you should also be able to access individual assignments through the links in Canvas. However, after the due date passes, you might still want to go back and look at previous assignments. To do that, you will want to access MyLab through the VitalSource tab on Canvas instead of through the individual assignment links. Then you should be able to go look at the MyLab gradebook and see previous assignments.  The due dates for assignments in MyLab should match what is shown in the syllabus. However, if you miss a due date, I still want you to do the homework and get a chance to practice what we're learning. So until the Friday before finals week assignments will allow you to continue working on them for full credit. I encourage you to still try to complete assignments by the deadlines! But I hope this is helpful if you do fall a little behind.  To continue working on an assignment after the due date , choose the improve my score option.  "

Moreover, in this classroom we will be working in groups for some of the time. It is essential that we all work together to create an environment where everyone is welcome.  In this class, we will work together to develop a learning community that is inclusive and respectful. Our diversity may be reflected by differences in race, culture, age, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic background, and myriad other social identities and life experiences. The goal of inclusiveness, in a diverse community, encourages and appreciates expressions of different ideas, opinions, and beliefs, so that conversations and interactions that could potentially be divisive turn instead into opportunities for intellectual and personal enrichment. A dedication to inclusiveness requires respecting what others say, their right to say it, and the thoughtful consideration of others' communication. Both speaking up and listening are valuable tools for furthering thoughtful, enlightening dialogue. Respecting one another's individual differences is critical in transforming a collection of diverse individuals into an inclusive, collaborative and excellent learning community. Our core commitment shapes our core expectation for behavior inside and outside of the classroom.  "

Military and Veteran Students  Military students who have the potential to participate in military activities including training and deployment should consult with faculty prior to registration for any course, but no later than the end of the first week of classes. For more information, visit the Office of Veteran and Military Student Affairs .  At this time, the student should provide the instructor with a schedule of planned absences, preferably signed by the student's commander, to allow the instructor to evaluate and advise the student on the possible impact of the absences. In this course, the instructor will consider absences due to participation in verified military activities to be excused absences, on par with those due to other unavoidable circumstances such as illness. If, however, it appears that military obligations will prevent adequate attendance or performance in the course, the instructor may advise the student to register for the course at another time, when they are more likely to be successful.

UCCS Student Code of Conduct and Professionalism  The purpose of the Student Code of Conduct is to maintain the general welfare of the university community. The university strives to make the campus community a place of study, work, and residence where people are treated, and treat one another, with respect and civility. This course covers material that could generate strong opinions or emotions. Consider the Daniels Fund Ethics Initiative Principles: Integrity, Trust, Accountability, Transparency, Fairness, Respect, Rule of Law, and Viability, when considering conduct during the course. Learn more at the Daniels Fund Ethics Initiative at UCCS website .    Academic Integrity and Plagiarism  The College of Business follows and enforces the student conduct rules and policies that are set forth by the university and are listed in the Student Rights and Responsibilities section of the Academic Catalog.  Students caught engaging in academic dishonesty may receive a zero on the assignment in question, an \"F\" in the class, or be suspended from the College of Business and\/or university. This includes, but is not limited to, plagiarism (copying others’ work as your own—in part or in total—without the proper citations) and\/or the use of artificial intelligence to write or contribute to assignments without instructor approval.    Generative AI  Given that anything generated by AI has been culled from the web and restated or recreated without attribution (and sometimes even with false attribution), that content could be considered as to have been plagiarized.  The use of generative AI tools is permitted in this course for the following activities:   Brainstorming and refining your ideas    Fine tuning your research questions    Finding information on your topic    Drafting an outline to organize your thoughts    Checking grammar and style     The use of generative AI tools is not permitted in this course for the following activities:   Quizzes and exams    Impersonating you in classroom contexts, such as by using the tool to compose discussion board replies or content that you put into a Teams or Zoom chat    Completing group work that your group has assigned to you, unless it is mutually agreed upon that you may utilize the tool    Writing a draft of a writing assignment    Writing entire sentences, paragraphs, or papers to complete class assignments       Copyright Statement  Unless otherwise noted, all materials contained in this course, including slide and video presentations, exams, study guides, outlines, and similar materials, are protected by copyright laws and university policy.

You may not reproduce, distribute, upload, display, or share any course materials, in whole or in part, without my express written consent. Unauthorized distribution of these materials to any website, either during or after the semester, is strictly prohibited.    Privacy Statement  Assuring privacy among faculty and students engaged in online and face-to-face instructional activities helps promote open and robust conversations and mitigates concerns that comments made within the context of the class will be shared beyond the classroom. As such, recordings of instructional activities occurring in online or face-to-face classes may be used solely for internal class purposes by the faculty member and students registered for the course, and only during the period in which the course is offered. Students will be informed of such recordings by a statement in the syllabus for the course in which they will be recorded. Instructors who wish to make subsequent use of recordings that include student activity may do so only with informed written consent of the students involved or if all student activity is removed from the recording. Recordings including student activity that have been initiated by the instructor may be retained by the instructor only for individual use.    Responsible Reporting: Institutional Equity\/Title IX Statement  The Office of Institutional Equity (OIE), administers the University of Colorado (CU) Sexual Misconduct policy (including Title IX), the UCCS Discrimination and Harassment Policy, and the CU Conflict of Interest in Cases of Amorous Relationships Policy. All UCCS faculty and staff, including student employees, are considered “responsible employees” and must report any suspected or known conduct that may be in violation of these policies (“prohibited conduct”) directly to the OIE. This reporting requirement exists to support the safety of our campus community, and there is no statute of limitations. Prohibited conduct includes unwanted verbal or physical conduct that is sexual in nature, or based on a protected class (such as, gender, race, veteran status, disability, etc.). You may review the Applicable Policies and OIE's Resolution Procedures here . While reporting prohibited conduct to the OIE is required by UCCS employees, participation in an OIE resolution process through the OIE is voluntary. Confidential reporting, and access to medical and mental health services, are available to students through the UCCS Wellness Center at 719-255-4444.    Diversity Statement  UCCS considers the diversity of its students, faculty, and staff to be a strength and critical to its educational mission. UCCS expects every member of the university community to contribute to an inclusive and respectful culture for all in its classrooms, work environments, and at campus events.

You may use an 8.5 inch by 11 inch page of notes (front and back), a blank Excel spreadsheet, blank scratch paper, and a scientific (or simpler) calculator.    You are NOT allowed to use other people's work or search internet sits while taking the test. If you share you answers and others use them, both you and the students you shared with may receive a zero for the exam and may fail the course.    Unless otherwise indicated, you must show steps that demonstrate the process you take to get to the final answer. If you use an Excel formula, provide that formula as part of your answer.  Credit will be given for not only the final answer, but the work\/justification that supports that answer.    If you have a question during the exam, ask me! It is much better to ask right away than to stay stuck for a long time.     Exam 1 Format  The exam will be partially on Canvas and partially on paper.      Part 1: On Canvas   This part of the exam will have the following problems\/types of problems:    Multiple choice problems from these chapters     Histogram: You will be given a dataset and asked to construct a histogram and describe the shape. You will need to do all of your work in Excel and upload the file to Canvas. (Be sure to give your histogram a title and label your axes. Also remember to follow all of the best practices for histograms discussed in class and in our textbook. This means that you should use the Rule to find the number of bins, and remember to include all of your work and label everything clearly.)     Box-and-whisker plot: You will be given a dataset and asked to construct a box-and-whisker plot for the data. You will need to list the values of the first three quartiles: Q1, Q2, and Q3 and identify any outliers in the data. You will need to do all of your work in Excel and upload the file to Canvas.

Suppose that for surveyed customers, 32 preferred the new user interface.   Find a confidence interval for the proportion of all the company's customers that prefer the new interface.    ,         Convidence interval formula:   The confidence interval is approximately:    Suppose the company claims that at least of all the company's customers prefer the new interface. Does the confidence interval you found support this claim? Explain why or why not.   No, it does not. We are confident that is between and , and is larger than .     Quiz outcome :   A CEO is curious if the proportion of employees that are satisfied with their job is greater than . They conduct a survey of employees. Suppose that for surveyed employees, 125 were satisfied with their job. Use and test the hypothesis that the proportion of all employees that are satisfied with their job is greater than .   State the null hypothesis.       State the alternative hypothesis.     (right-tail test)   Find the appropriate test statistic.       What is the p-value?       What do we conclude and why? Do we have enough evidence to conclude that the proportion of employees that are satisfied with their job is greater than ? Why or why not?   Since the p-value is bigger than , we fail to reject the null hypothesis. So there is not enough evidence to conclude that the proportion of employees that are satisfied with their job is greater than .     Quiz outcome :   A farmer is curious about the effects of a new fertilizer on the height of her corn stalks. She measures the heights of a random selection of her stalks. Out of 55 measured corn stalks, the sample average height is meters, with sample standard deviation meters.

Find the appropriate test statistic.       What is the p-value?   (This is a two-tail test.)     (or: )   What do we conclude and why? Do we have enough evidence to conclude that the average height of her corn stalks is not equal to 2.3 meters?   Since the p-value is less than , we reject the null hypothesis.

Calculate the appropriate test statistic.       Determine the appropriate critical value(s).   (This is a right-tailed test.)      Should you reject the null hypothesis or fail to reject the null hypothesis?   Since the test statistic is in the rejection region, we should reject the null hypothesis.

Since we rejected the null hypothesis, there is enough evidence to conclude that .     Week 10 HW Question 13:   Suppose a student has two possible routes for their commute to school. Because they never want to be late for class, they want to choose the route that provides a more consistent commute time. Being a hopeless statistician, the student meticulously drove the first route 20 times and the second route 25 times and calculated the standard deviations for each. The following table summarizes sample data collected from two different routes.      Route A  Route B    sample standard deviation  6.5 minutes  10.4 minutes    sample size  25  20      Using , we want to determine if Route A provides a more consistent commute time than Route B. First, state the null alternative hypotheses. (Let represent the larger sample variance and represent the smaller sample variance.)   (Since Route B has the bigger sample standard deviation, Route B is Population 1 and Route A is Population 2 .)         Calculate the appropriate test statistic.       Calculate the appropriate critical value (using ).       What can we conclude? Do we have enough evidence to conclude that Route A provides a more consistent commute time than Route B? Why or why not?   Since the test statistic is in the rejection region, we reject the null hypothesis and have enough evidence to conclude that Route A provides a more consistent commute time than Route B.    "

  "body": " Final Exam Information (The information below is not yet finalized!)  The Final Exam will take place in class on the day listed in the syllabus ( ).    The exam will cover 8, 9, 13, 10, and 14-15 from the textbook, which are Chapters 9-13 in the course notes ( Link to course notes )    You will have 120 minutes for the exam.    You may use an 8.5 inch by 11 inch page of notes (front and back), a blank Excel spreadsheet, blank scratch paper, and a scientific (or simpler) calculator.    You are NOT allowed to use other people's work or search internet sits while taking the test. If you share you answers and others use them, both you and the students you shared with may receive a zero for the exam and may fail the course.    Unless otherwise indicated, you must show steps that demonstrate the process you take to get to the final answer. If you use an Excel formula, provide that formula as part of your answer.  Credit will be given for not only the final answer, but the work\/justification that supports that answer.    If you have a question during the exam, ask me! It is much better to ask right away than to stay stuck for a long time.     Final Exam Format  The exam will be partially on Canvas and partially on paper.      Part 1: On Canvas   This part of the exam will have the following problems\/types of problems:    Multiple choice problems from these chapters. (No work is required to be shown for these.)    After the multiple choice problems, this part of the exam will have questions using Excel files. You will need to do your work in the Excel file, save it, and upload it back on Canvas. This part of the exam will have problems similar to the following:    Quiz Objective : ( Link to example solutions )  You'll need to submit an Excel file with your work for this problem. I'll ask the following things for this problem:   What is the p-value?    Should we reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis?    Is there enough evidence to conclude that the average difference in ... is greater than ... points?        Similar to parts of Questions 1 and 5 from the Week 14 Homework      Week 14 Homework Question 13            Part 2: On paper   This part of the exam will have problems similar to some or all of the following. (Some of these problems might not have all the parts that were on corresponding quiz\/homework problems, and some problems might have more parts to help guide you through the problem.) Note that some of these are similar to problems from Exam 2, so it would be helpful to also look at the similar problems on the exam and talk to me if you have any questions!
